# Implementation of Rank Aggregation with Proportionate Fairness in Java

## Description

This repository contains our implementations for the algorithms presented in the 
paper [Rank Aggregation with Proportionate Fairness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514221.3517865) by Wei et al.
It also contains the original source code from the paper, slightly refactored versions of the original source code, and the original dataset.

These implementations were developed to satisfy the requirements for the course [COP5725](https://arc.net/l/quote/wlyuhkrb).

## Running the Programs

This project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA by Jet Brains. To run the code, please use IntelliJ to open the project.
Then, select the file containing the algorithm you wish to run. Finally, click Run.

## Dependencies

This project relies on [OpenCSV](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/). The JAR file for OpenCSV should already be included in the project src folder.
