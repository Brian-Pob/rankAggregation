To find the codes for each of the algorithms:<br />
Subfolder codes --> Algorithm names


How to prepare the dataset: <br />
n number of items, m number of ranked lists, distribution of the protected attributes over the items to create proportion.  

How to use the code:<br />
Go to the folder named codes, change the line which contains the dataset path name and run the code.
